# Neural Network and Deep Learning

This repository include code for the coursera deep leaning spalization course "Neural Net and Deep Learning". 
Notebook of course has two layers neural network and N-Layers Neural Network Implementation in it.
To understand the code clone the repo and run the IPython files
Neural Network arrchitecture has input layer->Hidden layers and output layers 
Dimension for the weights of the layers are importent to understand the neural network properly and that will help to achieve good understanding of forward and backwardpropagation.

### Importent thing that one should know
To understand the backpropagation properly 
1. first calculate the cost 
2. use the chain rule to back propagate the error
follow the link to understand the maths of the back propagation
